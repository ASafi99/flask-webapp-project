# expense-tracker-flaskapp

## Introduction

The main goal of this project is to reinforce learning the technology and tools taught at the QA DevOps bootcamp through a practical project. The first objective is to firstly build a simple CRUD web application using Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy and CSS libraries such as Bootstrap. The project will be an expense tracker. After the first draft of the app is completed, it should then be containerised using Docker and a CI/CD pipeline will be built to automatically test, build and deploy the app.  The pipleline and containerisation process will be priortized over the app, hence the app will be simple. 

Below are a set of **user** stories that need to be fulfilled to complete the first version of the app:

As a user I want to be able to

- Create a wallet that will display my starting budget in a currency of either USD or GBP.
- Be able to record transactions of expenses and income. 
- Label my transactions with a category.
- Display a full history of transcactions made.
- Delete and edit any "Wallets", "transcations" and "category" easily. 

Each user story will be tracked as an item on GitHub's project management section, GitHub Boards.  For each item, you should use a feature branch model to create new work.

Each feature should also be fully unit tested. A feature is not complete until it has a unit test written for it.
